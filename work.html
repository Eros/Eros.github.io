                <p>The <a href="https://hypixel.net">Hypixel Network </a> is the largest Minecraft network in the world. As
                 a moderator I fulfill multiple roles including player support, server and player moderation, quality assurance (bugs)
                and more roles that are behind the scenes.</p>

                <p>Conquest was a prison network with a unique twist to how things were made. We implemented custom tasks,
                custom utils and tools all from scratch. As well as a custom cell system that used AmazonAWS to host and support everything.
                I departed from Conquest after it was acquired by the ArcadeWars Network, since then conquest has closed down.</p>

                    Hypixel API Wrappers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hypixel has a public API that anyone from the community can use with an API key that can be found on the server.
                    The original API is written in Java, I have made two wrappers for this to be supported in other languages.
                    These being C# and Ruby.

                    ECA is an Elliptic Curve Algorithm I wrote purely for the fun of it. It takes advantage of some basic
                    maths with elliptic systems and uses them for encryption
