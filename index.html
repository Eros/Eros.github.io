                <p>
                    For many years I have been learning a variety of programming languages, libraries, APIs and technology.
                    Below are the languages I am most fluent in, comfortable working with, and currently learning. As
                    well as some extra technology I use. A lot of the languages under secondary and learning are ones
                    that I think are interesting and will have some use some day, I am not completely fluent in them
                    but am very keen on continuing to learn them.

                        The <a href="https://hypixel.net">Hypixel Network</a> is the largest Minecraft network out there today
                        with a record of 64,000+ players and over 40 unique games the network has earned it's status. Since joining
                        I have been tasked with a multitude of duties ranging from quality assurance (bug finding, reporting, reports etc),
                        player management (dealing with hackers and rule breakers), small scale development and project management of the
                        staff client and a heap more. Being at the network has truly taught me a lot about myself and the business world,
                        the staff managers are very keen to help the staff with their future endeavors by providing insight on specific topics
                        they believe can benefit us.

                        <br>
                        As of 2017 I enrolled on a Computing course at the University of Western England to get a bachelors degree,
                        I am currently in my second of four years to obtain my degree and afterwards plan to do a masters in Cyber Security.
                        Being on this course has presented its challenges, however I am loving the degree and the work that comes with it.
                        Since enrolling we have been tasked with making the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Compression Algorithm (Written in C)</li>

                            <li>Database models (UML)</li>
                        </ul>
                        This is just a small percentage of what is to come.

                        <p>


                            I started programming at the age of 12, mainly having some fun with Batch and Visual Basic as well
                            as some very basic C. My love of technology and development stems from my family. While growing up I was raised in a household
                            of tech enthusiasts. My brothers and father have very successful careers working with tech on a day to day
                            basis, I have idolised them and look up to them as role models while learning and my current career.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            When I'm not writing code, looking into new technology or in a university lecture I like to keep myself busy.
                            I am an avid player of the sport Airsoft, a military simulation game that is heavily based around communication,
                            team work, objectives and the most fun part...chaos.
