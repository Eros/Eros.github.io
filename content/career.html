        <p><strong>Well then...</strong>
        <p>
        When I was 15 I had my mind set on doing something in art, and that all I ever wanted to do was put ink on peoples bodies, here their stories
        and earn a ton of money from it. I took GCSE Art and Design, only one big issue with me wanting to go down this career path... I can't draw to save my life,
        there were the few "good" pieces that I liked but it was clear to me that I cannot focus on this, I don't have the attention span to spend time drawing high
        detailed art, and that this wouldn't be for me. Now I love tattoos, I have them all over my arms with plans to get a large portion of my body <strong>(Deal with it if you don't like them)</strong>
        but I just knew deep down that this career wouldn't take me very far.

        I'd always been interested in computer and network systems, at the age of 9 i took apart the computer in my house, couldn't put it back together and my parents got real pissed at that.
        But I learnt a lot just by doing that, because I had just taught myself how to take apart a computer and somewhat put it back together without blowing it to bits. I was taking ICT in school,
        and did well in the subject, ended up with something like 2 A*'s and a B in the topic. Just thought to myself oneday this could be a new career path. But I never really enjoyed the hardware part,
        that's where software came in. I had a piece of software on my desktop for helping me with general tasks at school, well when I say general tasks I mean it was a python script I found online that
        bypassed the schools filtering system. Woops. I found out if I opened it with Notepad it would show me the code, well i thought it would. It was obfuscated. It was at this point I said to myself in class,
        and in front of my very strict teacher out loud <strong>HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS WORK?</strong>. Worth the 2 weeks detention I got, because that's what got me started.
        </p>

            Originally I started as a data analyst, I looked at numbers, data sets, binaries and my main focus was to find patterns in them, to find unique identifiers in each data set that we could use to either
            benefit the company or someone else. Eventually i got really bored of this, just sat staring at numbers all day I just couldn't do it anymore. I was working with a friend at a private company who had gotten me
            the job, well helped me. I felt bad about leaving because he stuck his neck on the line when he asked his boss, but I had, it was boring me, I wanted to and ended up sometimes sleeping on my desk because of how bored
            i become. So I left.
        </p>

            Fast forward a little bit, I had taken a very basic Python course online, self taught myself Java & C# and doing IT at college, I was focusing on college which was a mixture of hardware and programming
            in Visual Basic (yuck), I wanted to do more than make shitty games in Java & C#, I wanted to be able to do more than just random crap that would come into my mind, I wanted to turn this into a career path.
            At the time I looked around at Jobs and looked for the common denominator for what languages people needed the most, surprisingly it wasn't anything I learnt by myself already, people needed Python, C & C++
            developers the most. Okay fair enough. For nearly 2 years in while in college, learning hardware and working in visual basic on the sides I was teaching myself the basics, the core and advanced levels of these
            three languages, balancing this, hypixel, and college became real hard for me to do. But I knew that if i wanted to go down this path it would require the work. I stopped going out so much, I stopped partying,
            I even stopped dating for over a year (but that's an entirely different story that I will never tell) and I focused all my energy into becoming what I wanted to be. I focused on how networks work, how computers worked
            with the software interacting with the hardware, anything that would benefit me in the work place for a project.
        </p>

            Fast forward a bit more, I was happy with the place I had come with my goals. And I got a freelance offer with a client who was the biggest pain in the ass I had ever met. This is someone who had no knowledge of programming
            but whenever I was working on something he'd be sat right behind me, literally asking me what each line of code would do as I wrote it, and why I would delete something if I needed to. I thought well if this is what it's going to be
            like I don't want to go down this road. But a post on the Hypixel forums convinced me other whise. <strong><a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/some-career-advice-i-got-from-2006-wall-of-text.251819/">THIS</a></strong>
            post from <a href="https://twitter.com/NoxyWoxy">NoxyD </a> is what convinced me from quiting, the advice given in here has really helped me with taking my career here. And some other advice he had given me personally has
            tremendous amounts of help.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while I ended up with a few freelance projects under my belt, was happy with where I had come from, I'm at university studying computer science. And the main thing that I took away from all this,
            not every career path you chose ends up how you want to. I'm still interested in tattoos, still getting more, but the only thing that hasn't changed is my caffeine addiction.
